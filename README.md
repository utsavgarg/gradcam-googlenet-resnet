# Grad-CAM for GoogLenet and ResNet
Implementation of [grad-cam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) for GoogLenet and ResNet architechtures

### Setup
* Fullfill dependencies as required by the [author's repository](https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam)
* For ResNet-101 download model from [here](https://d2j0dndfm35trm.cloudfront.net/resnet-101.t7)

### Run


###About
* This repository is a minor modification over the code provided by authors [here](https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam) to add support for GoogLenet and ResNet-101 architectures, and most files are modifications over the original code provided.
* GoogLenet architecture and weights taken from [here](https://github.com/soumith/inception.torch.git)
* ResNet-101 model and image preprocessing are from [here](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch)
